# Hello-World
This is my first Hello World project.
# About Me:
I am Lay. I am originally from India and currently living in Chicago, IL. I have completed my 1st masterâ€™s in mechanical engineering and currently am working as a quality engineer in a contract manufacturing company (Flex). My company makes class 1 and class 2 medical devices and equipment. A deeper knowledge of data analysis can help me in providing support in improving the manufacturing process.
